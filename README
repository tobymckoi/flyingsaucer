RustBeast Patches for Flying Saucer by Tobias Downer
----------------------------------------------------

This repository contains various patches for Flying Saucer with the following
focus;

1. Improving rendering performance within Swing and Java 2D.
2. Improved support for embeddable UI components and customization.
3. Support for zoom.
4. Keep layout and rendering as similar as possible to other HTML/CSS rendering
   engines.

These patches are targeted to Java 1.7+ JREs. I might change a lot and break
stuff so be warned!

OVERVIEW

(or XHTML) using CSS 2.1 for layout and formatting, output to Swing panels, 
PDF, and images.

For information on our development releases, please contact us on our mailing lists.

If you end up using Flying Saucer for your own projects, please drop us an
email and tell us about it; it helps inform where we go next, and is interesting
and inspiring to other developers.

GETTING FLYING SAUCER
---------------------
New releases of Flying Saucer are distributed through Maven.  The available artifacts are:

org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-core - Core library and Java2D rendering
org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-pdf - PDF output using iText
org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-swt - SWT output
org.xhtmlrenderer:flying-saucer-log4j - Logging plugin for log4j

GETTING STARTED
---------------
There is a large amount of sample code under the flying-saucer-demos directory.
A pre-configured Eclipse project is provided to run a few of them.  

For users of other IDEs, make sure the src/java and resources directories under
the about, docbook, svg, and browser directories are available on the build
path.  samples/src and splash should also be in the build path.

flying-saucer-core, flying-saucer-pdf, and flying-saucer-swt must also be on the
build path as well as the an SWT JAR for your OS.

The Eclipse config files as committed with flying-saucer-swt use a Linux SWT
JAR.  You will need to update if using another OS.

org.xhtmlrenderer.demo.browser.BrowserStartup will start the browser demo.

Some good entry points (classes) are:
org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.XHTMLPanel
org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.PDFRenderer
org.xhtmlrenderer.simple.ImageRenderer
